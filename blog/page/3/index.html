<p>I took a few day reprieve from Tokyo to visit the Kansai prefecture.</p>

<p>While there, I visited Osaka and Nara. I was feeling a little bit unwell so
I skipped Kyoto/Kobe, but will be looking forward to visiting when I’m next
in Japan!</p>

<h3 id="getting-to-kansai">Getting to Kansai</h3>

<p>I decided to take an early morning Shinkansen (i.e. a bullet train) from Tokyo
to Osaka on Tuesday morning. Because my hotel stay was officially over, I
stayed the night in a “Manga Kissaten”. For the uninitiated, a Manga Kissa is
basically a somewhat skeevy 24/7 pay-per-hour library with free drinks and
private booths. I had heard that they were a reasonable place to stay – I
think I had a particularly bad one, the air was smoke filled, the drinks were
just OK, there was no shower in the morning, and they didn’t dim the lights
past midnight (these are all problems I’ve heard higher-end Manga Kissaten do
not suffer). Blearly eyed, I made my way to the train station and purchased a
ticket, and boarded the first train to Osaka.</p>

<p><img src="" alt="Shinkansen! Shinkansen!" /></p>

<h3 id="osaka">Osaka</h3>

<p>Upon arriving in Osaka I made my way down to a place called Spa World in an area
called Dotonbori-Mae. Unfortunately, they were overbooked/expensive so I looked
elsewhere nearby. After comparing the offerings across the street, I found a
really nice backpacker’s hostel where I was able to secure a private room
(Japanese style) for about $13 USD a night.</p>

<p><img src="" alt="Selfie in the hostel" /></p>

<p>From the hostel I decided to just walk the length of the city, starting from the
hostel all the way to Umeda. As a straight shot, this is about 4 miles, but I
wandered around so it was longer.</p>

<p>For lunch I ate okonomiyaki (a Japanese “pizza” that’s a little closer to a
omelette). It is served on a hot griddle, yum!</p>

<p><img src="" alt="" /></p>

<p>Later that night I went to the Don Quixote. DQ is like a wacky Walmart/Spencer’s
Gifts hybrid. It has everything from groceries to a sex shop. A few floors up
there was an (unrelated?) arcade/casino. I bought some chips and started playing
games. After playing for about an hour (and not doing very well), I went to cash
out my remaining tokens. I found out that tokens are not actually exchangeable
for <em>anything</em>. I asked some other players if they could help me exchange, and
they agreed because they thought you could cash out too. When they found out
they couldn’t, they seemed to be a little off put, but I gave them my tokens so
they were happy. What was weird is they even had a bank for the tokens…</p>

<p><img src="" alt="Token bank" /></p>

<h3 id="nara">Nara</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed my visit to Nara. The deer are so kawaii!</p>

<p>In Nara you can find the Tōdai-ji, or a temple featuring a huge bronze Buddha
(the largest bronze statue in the world and the largest Buddha in Japan). The
Tōdai-ji temple is also one of the largest wooden buildings in the world.</p>

    <p>I’m visiting Japan for two weeks to help teach <a href="https://bc-2.jp">BC-2</a> at
Digital Garage.</p>

<p>I’m very excited to have the chance to explore Tokyo and hope to make many new
friends while out here!</p>

<p>Hopefully I can fill in a few details about my trip as I go…</p>

<p>Well, I did it: I graduated MIT with my S.B. and M.Eng in 4 years! And
apparently I was the <a href="https://www.boston.com/culture/education/2016/06/03/8-joyously-nerdy-occurrences-mit-commencement">most

        Probabalistic Payments in Bitcoin using OP_SIZE
      </a>
  </h2>
  


    <span class="post-date">26 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>I designed a mechanism that allows for probabilistic payments in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The foundation of the mechanism is sane, where it veers out of “sanity” is in
the attempts to get it to work well off-chain.</p>

<p>I originally wrote this paper on November 26th, 2015, and circulated it among a
few colleagues. I think this is the first use case of OP_SIZE to implement XOR
fair coin flipping, although <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6956580/?reload=true&amp;arnumber=6956580">Secure Multiparty Computations on
Bitcoin</a>
has similar elements and it was discussed on IRC in #bitcoin-wizards that
OP_SIZE might enable probabilistic payments, but not specifically.</p>

<p>I am first posting it on my website as of March 11th, 2017.</p>
