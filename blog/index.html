        CheckSequenceVerify DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS Defect
      </a>
  </h2>
  


    <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2021</span>

    <p>The other day I was writing some tests for BIP-119 (shoutout
<a href="https://twitter.com/glozow">Gloria</a> for the detailed feedback on improving
tests). I noticed something peculiar while attempting to write static test
vectors for CTV. This peculiar thing led me to discover a minor flaw in
Bitcoin’s interpreter – it isn’t going to break anything in the short term,
but it has implications for how certain upgrades might be done in the future.</p>

<p>In the interpreter we pass specific flags in at different times to check
different rules at different times. This is used because we generally want the
Mempool to be “restrictive” and block validation to be unrestrictive.  That
sounds like the opposite of what you would want, but it’s because we want to
ensure that we never break a consensus rule, so our mempool is “strict” to
protect e.g. a miner from making a bad block, because our node’s understanding
of consensus validation is less strict so we always know the mempool is full of
stuff that will pass consensus.</p>

<p>One of the specific types of “stricter” that is in the mempool is for things
that may be changed in the future. For example, Taproot (a change proposed to
Bitcoin) uses a Witness V1 script. Before Taproot activates, Witness V1 Scripts
are <em>always</em> valid no matter if they’re signed or not. After it activates, a
new rule takes effect in consensus, and Witness V1 Scripts will be processed in
accordance with Taproot’s rules. Because the Mempool is stricter, it never lets in
any Witness V1 script spends until it knows how to properly validate it. That way,
for a miner who doesn’t want to upgrade to Taproot, they can use the old rules in their
Mempool and not ever mine a bad block.</p>

<p>One of the flags used for this purpose is DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS. A NOP
is simply an opcode in bitcoin that has no effect (nada). In the future,
someone could add a rule to that NOP (e.g., check that the stack args present
when the NOP executes satisfy some properties or the transaction is invalid,
but do not remove anything from the stack so that the old consensus rules still
seem correct). This is sufficient for consensus, but maybe people have decided
that they want to create a bunch of outputs with NOPs in it because they are
cute. Then, a fork that would add new semantics to a NOP would have the impact
of locking people out of their wallets.  To prevent this, the Mempool uses the
rule DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS which makes it so that if you try to
broadcast an output script with a NOP it gets bounced from the Mempool (but not
consensus of course, should a deviant miner mine such a transaction). Hopefully
our users get the message to not use NOPs because we… discourage upgradable
nops.</p>

<p>CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) was one such NOP before it grew up to be a big n’
important opcode. Essentially all that CSV does is check that the sequence
field is set in a particular manner. This lets you set relative block and time
lock (e.g., takes this much time before a coin is spendable again). However,
it’s possible that we might come up with new kinds of lock times in the future,
so we have a bit we can set in the sequence that makes it ignored for consensus
purposes. Maybe in the future, someone would find something nice to do with it,
eh?</p>

<p>This is the sequence verification code:</p>

<p>Here, where we say it behaves as a NOP we don’t check any rules and skip the checks.</p>

<p>See where the problem lies? If we ever <em>did</em> get around to a future upgrade
here, then old miners who refuse to upgrade would be more than happy to accept
invalid transactions into their mempool, and then following the fork, would end
up mining invalid blocks leading to potential network partitions.</p>

<p>That would be bad! Let’s not do that.</p>

<p>What we really should be doing is:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which is exactly what I propose to do in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871">this PR</a>.</p>

<p>If this solution is adopted, then after the last release of the Bitcoin Core
Implementation that has the unpatched code goes
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/">End-of-Life</a>, we could safely deploy
new sequence rules. Because it takes a while for software to go EOL, I hope we
can patch this soon.</p>

        Infrastructure Bill: It's Go Time for Radical Self Custody
      </a>
  </h2>
  


    <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2021</span>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/utxos.org/pull/4">TL;DR: click here to answer call to action</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/utxos.org/pull/4"> <img src="/public/img/bitcoin/virginchadcustody.png" alt="" /> </a></p>

<p>The infrastructure bill draft has been circulating which contains language that
would have massive impact for the crypto ecosystem (and Bitcoin) in the United
States, and most likely globally. The broad implication of the proposed bill is
that many types of service provider would be categorized as brokers, even if
fully ‘non custodial’. E.g., a coinjoin coordinator might be a broker, even if
they never take control of the funds, because they are facilitating a
transaction. There’s a lot of nuance, and the language is still being changed,
so we’ll see where it lands. But that’s not the point of this blog post.</p>

<p>The point of this blog post is that we need to <em>hurry the fuck up</em> and improve
the self-sovereign software available and widely used by bitcoiners. You heard
me right, <em>hurry the fuck up</em>.</p>

<p>While there’s space for debate around perfect designs and optima for protocol
improvements, these discussions take years to turn into code running in end
users wallets. I do not believe that we have time to leisurely improve
self-sovereign custody solutions while regulators figure out a wrench to throw
in our spokes.</p>

<p>Why am I so concerned about this bill in particular? A confidential source
tells me that this language came out of the blue, an executive branch driven
regulatory ninja attack of sorts. Normally, when the government looks to
regulate an industry, the provisions and terms get floated around by
legislators for a long while with industry input, comment periods, and more.
Then, when a bill or other rules get passed, it’s something that the industry
has at least had a chance to weigh in on and prepare for. My source claims no
one has seen the clauses in the infrastructure bill before, and they infer that
may mean this is a part of a broader crack-down coming from specific political
personalities and agencies. This means we may be seeing government actions
further restricting users’ rights in the pipeline much sooner than anyone could
anticipate.</p>

<p>I’ve long been saying that we should be deploying <a href="https://utxos.org">BIP-119
CTV</a> for congestion control <em>before</em> we see broad congestion
on the network. If you wait until a problem is manifest, it can take years to
deploy a solution. This merits proactivity in solving a problem before it
comes. Today, the need to improve self-custody looms urgently on the horizon.</p>

<p>CTV is not a panacea solution. It doesn’t magically fix all custodial issues.
But, along with <a href="https://learn.sapio-lang.org">Sapio</a>, it does offer a pathway
to dramatically improving self custody options, letting users customize vault
smart contracts which do not depend on any third parties. Deploying CTV now is
an opportunity to put in motion the wheels for broad ecosystem support for
these enhanced custody protocols. We may come up with better options in the
future which may obsolete CTV in place of more clever technologies. I cheer
those efforts. But we need solutions for Tomorrow.</p>

<p>A soft fork activation for CTV could be deployable for Bitcoin imminently,
should the community embrace it. The spec is nearly 2 years old, the code has
required only small updates to be mergeable with other changes to Bitcoin Core.
The review burden is 185 lines of consensus code, and a couple hundred lines of
tests. To that end I believe it is prudent for the Bitcoin community to embrace
the deployment of CTV and I’m calling on the community to <a href="https://github.com/JeremyRubin/utxos.org/pull/4">soft-signal
intent</a> for a soft-fork
activation of CTV.</p>

<p>We cannot control what rules state authorities attempt to mandate. But we can
individually control our own compliance with measures we see as unjust, and as
a community we can advance technologies and solutions that ensure that choice
remains squarely in the hands of every user and not the service providers they
may use.</p>

        BIP-118 What Gets Hashed Chart
      </a>
  </h2>
  


    <span class="post-date">09 Jul 2021</span>

    <p>As a part of my ongoing review of BIP-118 I put together a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KeWJ_cly9zoRX5_h70RTniRT2m8_iaVceK_aF6obWeM">chart</a>
of what gets hashed under the current proposal.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KeWJ_cly9zoRX5_h70RTniRT2m8_iaVceK_aF6obWeM"><img src="/public/img/bip-118.png" alt="BIP-118 Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Not tightly checked to be free of errors, but I figured such a chart would be
helpful for folks evaluating BIP-118.</p>

<p>Perhaps the BIPs (generally, incl 34x) could be updated to present the
information in such a chart – at least for me it’s much clearer than following
a bunch of conditional logic (maybe if there’s ever desire for some consensus
refactoring this could be a table in the code replacing the cond logic).
A few highlighted nuances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>input index is never signed (i previously thought one mode signed it). Key reuse under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APOAS | Default</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APOAS | All</code> is a bit extra unsafe given susceptibility to the “half-spend” problem. This limits usability of APO for covenants a-la CTV because you can’t stop someone from adding inputs to your contract nor can you prevent half-spend problems when reusing addresses.</li>
  <li>APO signs the Amounts, APOAS never does.</li>
  <li>APO signs both the SPK and the Tapleaf hash, meaning that APO binds itself to the entire script rather than just it’s fragment. There’s no setting which is “just this fragment”</li>
  <li>APO’s signature binds it to a specific script fragment <em>within</em> a taproot key, but not a specific script path</li>
  <li>the flag “default” is not really a flag at all – when default is used (as a or’d byte) there are different results than when default is inferred (by absence of a byte) (this is maybe a bitcoin core specific quirk).</li>
  <li>There are 16 different possible modes total, so all combinations of flags mean <em>something</em> (advisable or not as with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACP | None</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*| Default</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*| All</code> overlap, so there’s an opportunity to either reserve or assign 4 additional sighash modes if desired. These could cover some of the gaps above, or be saved for future purposes rather than be wasted now. Another point of interest is – not to rock the boat – but because BIP-118 is defining a new key type we could do away with the notion that sighash flags are “flags” and convert to an enum (e.g., numbered 0-256 for whatever combination of fields each would incur) and give each signature type a sensible name, rather than thinking of things as a combo of flags (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APOAS</code> is not some intersection of what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APO</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ACP</code> do independently).</li>
</ul>

        Quantum Proofing Bitcoin with a CAT
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>no cats harmed in the making of this post</h4>


    <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2021</span>

    <p>I recently published <a href="https://rubin.io/blog/2021/07/02/signing-5-bytes/">a blog
post</a> about signing up to a
5 byte value using Bitcoin script arithmetic and Lamport signatures.</p>

<p>By itself, this is neat, but a little limited. What if we could sign longer
messages? If we can sign up to 20 bytes, we could sign a HASH160 digest which
is most likely quantum safe…</p>

<p>What would it mean if we signed the HASH160 digest of a signature? What the
what? Why would we do that?</p>

<p>Well, as it turns out, even if a quantum computer were able to crack ECDSA, it
would yield revealing the private key but not the ability to malleate the
content of what was actually signed.  I asked my good friend and cryptographer
<a href="https://madars.org/">Madars Virza</a> if my intuition was correct, and he
confirmed that it should be sufficient, but it’s definitely worth closer
analysis before relying on this. While the ECDSA signature can be malleated to a
different, negative form, if the signature is otherwise made immalleable there
should only be one value the commitment can be opened to.</p>

<p>If we required the ECDSA signature be signed with a quantum proof signature
algorithm, then we’d have a quantum proof Bitcoin! And the 5 byte signing scheme
we discussed previously is a Lamport signature, which is quantum secure.
Unfortunately, we need at least 20 contiguous bytes… so we need some sort of
OP_CAT like operation.</p>

<p>OP_CAT can’t be directly soft forked to Segwit v0 because it modifies the
stack, so instead we’ll (for simplicity) also show how to use a new opcode that
uses verify semantics, OP_SUBSTRINGEQUALVERIFY that checks a splice of a string
for equality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fun Fact: OP_CAT existed in Bitcoin untill 2010, when Satoshi “secretly”
forked out a bunch of opcodes. So in theory the original Bitcoin implementation
supported Post Quantum cryptography out of the box!</p>

<p>That’s a long script… but will it fit? We need to verify 20 bytes of message
each bit takes around 10 bytes script, an average of 3.375 bytes per number
(counting pushes), and two 21 bytes keys = 55.375 bytes of program space and 21
bytes of witness element per bit.</p>

<p>It fits! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20*8*55.375 = 8860</code>, which leaves 1140 bytes less than the limit for
the rest of the logic, which is plenty (around 15-40 bytes required for the rest
of the logic, leaving 1100 free for custom signature checking). The stack size
is 160 elements for the hash gadget, 3360 bytes.</p>

<p>This can probably be made a bit more efficient by expanding to a ternary
representation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        SWAP hash160 DUP &lt;H(K_j_i_0)&gt; EQUAL  IF DROP  ELSE &lt;3**i&gt; SWAP DUP &lt;H(K_j_i_T)&gt; EQUAL IF DROP SUB ELSE &lt;H(K_j_i_1)&gt; EQUALVERIFY ADD  ENDIF ENDIF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should bring it up to roughly 85 bytes per trit, and there should be 101
trits (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log(2**160)/log(3) == 100.94</code>), so about 8560 bytes… a bit cheaper!
But the witness stack is “only” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2121</code> bytes…</p>

<p>As a homework exercise, maybe someone can prove the optimal choice of radix for
this protocol… My guess is that base 4 is optimal!</p>

<h2 id="taproot">Taproot?</h2>

<p>What about Taproot? As far as I’m aware the commitment scheme (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Q = pG + hash(pG
|| m)G</code>) can be securely opened to m even with a quantum computer (finding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code>
such that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qG = Q</code> might be trivial, but suppose key path was disabled, then
finding m and p such that the taproot equation holds should be difficult because
of the hash, but I’d need to certify that claim better).  Therefore this
script can nest inside of a Tapscript path – Tapscript also does not impose a
length limit, 32 byte hashes could be used as well.</p>

<p>Further, to make keys reusable, there could be many Lamport keys comitted inside
a taproot tree so that an address could be used for thousands of times before
expiring. This could be used as a measure to protect accidental use rather than
to support it.</p>

<p>Lastly, Schnorr actually has a stronger non-malleability property than ECDSA,
the signatures will be binding to the approved transaction and once Lamport
signed, even a quantum computer could not steal the funds.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2021</span>

    <p>I recently published <a href="https://rubin.io/blog/2021/07/02/covenants/">a blog post</a>
about covenants on Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Readers were quick to point out I hadn’t
fully explained myself on a claim I made that you can do a form of
CheckSigFromStack in Bitcoin today.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be worthwhile to fully describe the technique – for the
archives.</p>

<p>There are two insights in this post:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to use a bitwise expansion of the number</li>
  <li>to use a lamport signature</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at the code in python and then translate to bitcoin script:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">add_bit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">idx</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">preimage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">image_0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">image_1</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So what’s going on here? The signer generates a key which is a list of pairs of
hash images to create the script.</p>

<p>To sign, the signer provides a witness of a list of preimages that match one or the other.</p>

<p>During validation, the network adds up a weighted value per preimage and checks
that there are no left out values.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine a concrete use case: I want a third party to post-hoc sign a sequence lock. This is 16 bits.
I can form the following script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pk&gt; checksigverify

<p>In order to sign a 16 bit value V, the owner of K simply puts on the stack the
binary representation of V indexed into the K. E.g., to sign <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">53593</code>, first
expand to binary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0b1101000101011001</code>, then put the appropriate K values on the
stack.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>K_15_1
K_14_1
K_13_0
K_12_1
K_11_0
K_10_0
K_9_0
K_8_1
K_7_0
K_6_1
K_5_0
K_4_1
K_3_1
K_2_0
K_1_0
K_0_1
&lt;sig&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This technique is kind of bulky! It’s around 80x16 = 1280 length for the
gadget, and 528 bytes for the witnesses. So it is <em>doable</em>, if not a bit
expensive. There might be some more efficient scripts for this – would a
trinary representation be more efficient?</p>

<p>The values that can be signed can be range limited either post-hoc (using
OP_WITHIN) or internally as was done with the 16 bit value circuit where it’s
impossible to do more than 16 bits.</p>

<p>Keys <em>can</em> be reused across scripts, but signatures may only be constructed one
time because a third party could take two signed messages and construct an
unintended value (e.g., if you sign both 4 and 2 then a third party could
construct 6).</p>

<p>There are certain applications where this could be used for an effect – for
example, an oracle might have a bonding contract whereby posessing any K_i_0
and K_i_1 allows the burning of funds.</p>
